This repository hosts the R script named "run_analysis.R" and its codebook named "CodeBook.md". The proper performance of the R script takes for granted that all the data (available here:https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is present in the same folder, uncompressed and without names altered. The script transforms the original data into a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis. The data source, variables of the data set and the transformations performed can be found in the codebook.
